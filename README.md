Title: MarieKondoIt

I started building the app as assigned, but later on noticed that the instructions said we're free to reinterpret it. For a while I thought wouldn't it be nice to have an app that encourages donations, where you can list your unwanted items, choose a charity and maybe even have them pick it up. This concept lend itself well to it so I decided to shift the focus of the front end toward that idea. 

Packages used:
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.2",
    "mysql": "^2.17.1",
    "orm": "^5.0.4"

Installation
To get the app running, run "npm i" to install the packages. Once installed, open "server.js" in the terminal to start the server listening. The app is setup to run on localhost: 8080.

How to use?
It's simple -- think of items you may not want, or as Marie Kondo says -- that don't bring you joy -- and queue them up for donation. Then, when you have your whole list and are confident about your donation, hit the button and move it to the final donation list.
